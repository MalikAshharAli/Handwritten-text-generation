# ✍️ Handwritten Text Generation with Deep Learning

This project demonstrates how AI can **write like a human** using deep learning. We train a model to generate **handwritten text** that looks natural and personal — just like it was written by a real person!

---

## 📌 About the Project

Handwriting is more than just text — it’s style, motion, and expression. In this project:

- We use **stroke-based data** (x, y coordinates + pen state).
- Train a deep learning model (RNN) to **learn how people write**.
- Generate new handwritten text using the trained model.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

- ✅ RNN-based model (LSTM) for handwriting generation
- ✅ Visualization of generated strokes
- ✅ Trained using:
  - [IAM Handwriting Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/iam)
  - [Deepwriting Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/deepwriting)
  - [HKR Dataset (Korean)](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/hkr)
- ✅ Clean and beginner-friendly Jupyter Notebook
- ✅ Dummy data for quick testing

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-text-generation.git
   cd handwritten-text-generation
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook
Open Handwritten_Text_Generation.ipynb and follow the instructions.

(Optional) Download IAM / Deepwriting datasets manually and convert to stroke format.
